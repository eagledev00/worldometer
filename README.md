## Demo

> [!NOTE]
> *The first time you run any function/method or class, it will download Chromium to  `~/.local/share/pyppeteer` directory. It only happens once. After, it will only open the chromium to render the contents of worldometers.info.*

Get the data from the live counters available on the [homepage](https://www.worldometers.info/):

```python
>>> from worldometer.world import WorldCounters

>>> wc = WorldCounters()

>>> wc.world_population.current_population
8065299074

>>> wc.government_and_economics.computers_produced_this_year
180248430

>>> wc.society_and_media.internet_users_in_the_world_today
5895566559
```

Reload data to get the latest:

```python
>>> wc.reload_data()
>>> wc.world_population.current_population
8065300592
```

Get help and view information about mapped sections:

```python
>>> help(wc)
```
